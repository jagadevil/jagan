present and future? in all languages, time is divided into 3 frames- now- refers to the current time (present tense) past- refers to the time before now (past tense) future- refers to the time after now (future tense) continue..  in this module, we will understand- what tenses are regular verbs irregular verbs when and how to use the past, present and future tenses correct usage of verb forms in different tenses forward back  as you can observe in the table above, to denote different tense forms, verb forms need to be changed. past present future simple i studied i study i will study continuous i was studying i am studying i will be studying perfect i had studied i have studied i will have studied depending on the time of action, verbs need to be changed in various forms such as their past, present participle and past participle. helping verbs like ‘will, have, be’ are also used for denoting different tenses. therefore, let us first understand regular and irregular verbs and how their forms are changed. back </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6bjyVJbCUbw.6c174W8cEcA" slidebank="false">regular and irregular verbs regular verbs verbs that form their past and past participle forms by adding -d or -ed to their base forms are regular verbs. when you want to change the base form of a regular verb to its past form, suffix –d to those verbs that end with a vowel and –ed to those ending  with a consonant. for example,  please explain your statement. he explained his statement. type this letter for me. she typed the letter for me. she can bake delicious pastries. she baked delicious pastries. </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6bjyVJbCUbw.5YvNjBUEH0U" slidebank="false">list of some regular verbs and their forms simple past past participle worry worried worried attack

scold scolded scolded list of some regular verbs and their forms (contd.)  type typed typed </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6bjyVJbCUbw.6BbMtyP9jCM" slidebank="false">examples case in the above table, did you notice that not all of the forms follow the simple addition of -d or -ed.  click examples to read the rules for special cases.  the fish was fried till it turned golden brown. (fry) rule examples when a verb ends with -y, preceded by a consonant, we drop the -y and add -ied. she is married to a famous industrialist. (marry) when the verb ends with -y, preceded by a vowel, you should only add -ed without dropping -y. geeta stayed with me for a couple of weeks. (stay) when a verb ends with a consonant that is preceded by a vowel, the consonant is repeated in the past form. (-ed is suffixed) i dragged my cycle which had a flat tyre. (drag) she admitted that she had stolen the money. (admit) </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6bjyVJbCUbw.6bTK08jS6wu" slidebank="false">irregular verbs the difference between a regular and an irregular verb is in the way how their past and past participle forms are formed. the simple past and past participle forms of irregular verbs could take various forms, with no regularity in their pattern. the most common errors that we make with irregular verbs are to add -d or -ed to form their past tenses. e.g.: swimmed, teached, etc.  irregular verbs do not follow the standard rules of verb forms. therefore there is no other way of avoiding mistakes with irregular verbs than to learn them all.  go through as many of them as possible along with their past and participle forms.  </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6bjyVJbCUbw.62RB7vzVffX" slidebank="false">irregular verb list simple past past participle begin began  begun build built built tell told told steal stole stolen spend spent spent break broke broken come came come sit sat sat sing sang sung dig dug dug choose chose chosen  simple past past participle list of some regular verbs and their forms (contd.)  eat ate eaten fall fell fallen run ran run ring rang rung feed fed fed hide hid hidden swing swung swung put put put quit quit quit tear tore torn  simple past past participle list of some regular verbs and their forms (contd.)  read read (pronounce as red) read (pronounce as red) see saw seen slide slid slid feel felt felt grind ground ground </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6bjyVJbCUbw.6Z4Qzh48a9y" slidebank="false">if you have gone through the list of verbs and their forms thoroughly, let us move on to tenses again. you will now find it much easier to align the correct verb forms with the appropriate tenses. past/ present/  future simple perfect perfect continuous continuous </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6bjyVJbCUbw.5Vv8pETwlzJ" slidebank="false">tenses past, present and future present past future radha is eating a mango. radha was eating a mango. radha will eat a mango. he is sad to hear the news. he was sad to hear the news. he will be sad to hear the news. joseph is writing a book on apiculture. joseph was writing a book on apiculture. joseph will write a book on apiculture. rateesh helps us in all possible ways. rateesh helped us in all possible ways. rateesh will help us in all possible ways. prem works hard to make it through. prem worked hard to make it through. prem will work hard to make it through. continue.. check your answers for activity 1 here-  the tense charts given in a concise format give you an idea of how to construct sentences correctly to indicate the correct time frame.  tenses past, present and future knowledge of tenses is essential for proper sentence formation. the examples given will make the usage and syntax of each tense form clear. back </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6bjyVJbCUbw.6k1JQhxXNHa" slidebank="false">tense simple  present present continuous present  perfect present perfect continuous  when do i  use it? to show an action which happens now or many a times. it also shows your habits, abilities or general facts. to show an action that is happening right now.  also shows an action planned for future. to show an action that finished recently, though its time of completion is not mentioned. to show an action which began in the past but is still continuing in the present. how do i use it? verb in its base form and should agree with the subject is/am/are +verb+ing has/have+past participle form of verb has/have been+ verb+ing examples ashwin sleeps in his room. ashwin is sleeping in his room.

the bare brown mountains topped with green trees were a feast for our eyes. we sped up towards the trekking area but soon got drained as our rucksacks, which contained ample provision for the day, were heavy and impeded our progress. at last we dragged ourselves into the base camp that had been arranged for us. the second hurdle that awaited us was that we had to cook food for ourselves.  </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6nW4bSWOGpc.6H7m5xg9ZGX" slidebank="false">subject and predicate  start </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6nW4bSWOGpc.5eBQ6uSXLB1" slidebank="false">in a sentence, we essentially include two parts- we identify a person or a thing. (the subject) mention something about the person or thing. (the predicate) for example- the mountain is covered with snow. in this sentence, what we are speaking about is the mountain, which makes it the subject; what is being spoken about the mountain is that it is covered with snow- this is the predicate of the sentence. thus, all sentences consist essentially of two parts- the subject and the predicate.  continue..  consider the same example again- (the mountain is covered) with snow. the part of the sentence enclosed in brackets is a complete sentence in itself, with a subject (the mountain) and predicate (is covered). in addition to the subject and predicate, there is a complement which gives you more information. thus, a predicate could be a single word verb or consist of complements which tell us more about what the subject does. back.. </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6nW4bSWOGpc.6nUwKM5R8Qv" slidebank="false">identifying subject and predicate many a times, the subject is not as easily identifiable as in the previous examples. here comes the prince. this is the sweetest song i’ve ever heard. in such cases, the subject can be spotted by asking questions 'who'   or 'what'. here, the answer to who comes is ‘the prince’, therefore it is the subject. sometimes when a sentence is used for giving a command, such as in an imperative sentence, the subject isn’t quite visible. for e.g.: take your seat. here the hidden but obvious subject is ‘you’. continue..  identifying subject and predicate in a sentence, there could be more than one subject joined by and, or, either, neither…nor. for example- kangaroos and koala bears are marsupials. is your uncle or aunt coming? thus, to identify a subject, try to understand who or what the sentence talks about. this will be clear from the exercises that follow. back..

slidebank="false">having plural subjects with singular verbs or the reverse, results  in confusing sentences, which fail to convey your meaning.  this becomes particularly important when long phrases separate the subject from the verb. understanding subject-verb agreement helps you create clear sentences that the reader or listener will understand. the simple and only rule to remember in subject-verb agreement is ‘singular verb for singular subject and plural verb for plural subject.’ before learning the rules for subject-verb agreement, let us briefly take up what a subject in a sentence means. continue..  what is a subject? a subject is the ‘head-word’ in a sentence. the subject is the most important word in a sentence. the subject may also be treated as ‘naming word’. that is, the subject may be the names of the persons, places or pronouns. what is a predicate? a predicate is the verb or verbal group in a sentence. the verb is also known as a saying part, it tells the action done by the subject. back.. forward.. he (mohan) writes i am singing cows give milk maria is a hardworking girl subject predicate  in the sentences, the number of the subject (singular or plural) matches with the number of verb. there are some definite rules governing the agreement of subjects with verbs which will be taken up here. back.. forward.. he (mohan) (singular) writes (singular) i (singular) am singing (singular) cows (plural) give milk (plural) maria (singular) is a hardworking girl (singular) subject predicate  the plurals of verbs are usually their base forms themselves.  e.g.: give, make, etc. their singular forms are usually formed by suffixing -s to them. the easiest and usually the most reliable way to identify subjects is to ask and answer the questions ‘who’ and ‘what’.  for example, rohan is going to brazil. (who is going?- rohan) it is also important to keep in mind the ‘person’ - 1st, 2nd or 3rd that is being used in the sentence. back.. </slidetext><slidetext slideid="5iBdq9qw8pZ.5gxNJnUpPXk" slidebank="false">person - who is being spoken about? 1st person or the self (i, me, we) 2nd person or the person spoken to (you) 3rd person or the person spoken about (he, she, him, her, they, them). knowledge of ‘persons’ is important from subject verb agreement point of view as verbs change form with different persons. as can be seen from the table- continue..  person - who is being spoken about? verbs are always plural with 1st and 2nd  persons. they take singular and plural forms with 3rd person depending on whether the subject is singular or plural. e.g. farida wakes up at 5 everyday. (singular) they wake up at 5 everyday.

reading as a habit read as much as you can from as many sources as possible. reading at bed-time is a must for those who do not find time during their busy work hours. make books your best friends. get a library membership if possible to have access to quality books. continue..  2. fluency is a must fluency is the ability to read quickly and accurately with ease. it is important from comprehension point of view because those who do read fluently can concentrate better on the comprehension part as they are not disrupted by words.  if you’re not fluent in reading, you will have to take time to read individual words and split sentences into several bits. in the process, all of your attention gets diverted towards reading properly and there is little room for understanding. get into the habit of reading your text aloud. this will let you understand what portions of the text you are getting stuck at. highlight those areas and read again with more attention and emphasis. use the chart given here to understand your progress. back.. forward..  back.. attempt number time that i took number of places where interrupted number of points that i recall number of words i didn’t

you are required to skim through text at a short notice.  do not worry if you can’t read too fast. speed reading is a good skill to possess, but it isn’t really an absolute requirement. what is more important is fluency, which will automatically make your reading speed well above average. also, there are situations where reading fast is not recommended, for instance, legal documents, important files, text to be proofread, etc. here, comprehension, regardless of the reading speed is mandatory.  thus, keep your speed flexible conforming to the demand of the situation. forward.. back..  4. take a step at a time practising comprehension passages is a good way of improving comprehension skills. start with simple text where you can answer all related questions effortlessly. once you are confident to move to the next level, head for it. all this is bound to take some time depending on individual capabilities; do not expect overnight results. if you take up challenging texts in the first place, you may end up being disappointed. back.. forward..  5. frame questions in your mind after you have read your passage, pen down all the questions that come to your mind. with every little detail provided in the passage, you could raise a couple of relevant questions.  underline difficult words, phrases and idiomatic expressions and try to search their meaning. if you are able to answer most of the questions raised, you can be sure that you have understood it all well. back.. forward..  6. knotty words as discussed in the vocabulary section, new and difficult words are not problematic if you can identify hints and guess their meaning. refer to vocabulary section for more details and exercises. forward.. back..  7. visualising and note making after having read the extract, form a mental picture of the situation that you just read about. in reading comprehension, imagination is a good tool as it helps understand text better. this is because images leave a deeper impact on recalling efficiency as compared to something that is heard or read. put all the pieces of information in the paragraph together to make a complete picture.  make subtle notes of the important highlights which are decisive in your comprehension of the text. forward.. back..  8. what’s it all about? every passage revolves around an idea, which is the central theme that it speaks about.  it may not be expressed in one word or sentence; you will have to understand the whole thing before you can judge what the main idea is. the main theme of the passage is always backed by details to support it.  look for examples, facts, opinions, types, supporting ideas, conclusions, comparisons, statistics, etc. which define the tone of the passage. forward.. back..  back.. 8. what’s

A thesaurus is a book that gives you synonyms just as a dictionary is a collection of word meanings. Learning synonymous words is also a good way of boosting your vocabulary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face='Symbol' size='11.64pt' color='#444444'&gt;·&lt;tab&gt;&lt;/tab&gt;&lt;/font&gt;Use what you learn.

In the process, all of your attention gets diverted towards reading properly and there is little room for understanding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face='Symbol' size='11.64pt' color='#444444'&gt;·&lt;tab&gt;&lt;/tab&gt;&lt;/font&gt;Get into the habit of reading your text aloud. This will let you understand what portions of the text you are getting stuck at. Highlight those areas and read again with more attention and emphasis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face='Symbol' size='11.64pt' color='#444444'&gt;·&lt;tab&gt;&lt;/tab&gt;&lt;/font&gt;Use the chart given here to understand your progress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/textformat&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align='left'&gt;&lt;textformat leading='1' tabstops='[48, 96]' leftmargin='0' indent='0'&gt;&lt;font face='Articulate' size='11.64pt' color='#444444'&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

Speed reading is a good skill to possess, but it isn’t really an absolute requirement. What is more important is fluency, which will automatically make your reading speed well above average.&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face='Symbol' size='11.64pt' color='#444444'&gt;·&lt;tab&gt;&lt;/tab&gt;&lt;/font&gt;Also, there are situations where reading fast is not recommended, for instance, legal documents, important files, text to be proofread, etc. Here, comprehension, regardless of the reading speed is mandatory. &lt;br&gt;&lt;font face='Symbol' size='11.64pt' color='#444444'&gt;·&lt;tab&gt;&lt;/tab&gt;&lt;/font&gt;Thus, keep your speed flexible conforming to the demand of the situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/textformat&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align='left'&gt;&lt;textformat leading='1' tabstops='[48, 96]' leftmargin='0' indent='0'&gt;&lt;font face='Articulate' size='11.64pt' color='#444444'&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

Once you are confident to move to the next level, head for it.

With every little detail provided in the passage, you could raise a couple of relevant questions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;font face='Symbol' size='11.64pt' color='#444444'&gt;·&lt;tab&gt;&lt;/tab&gt;&lt;/font&gt;Underline difficult words, phrases and idiomatic expressions and try to search their meaning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face='Symbol' size='11.64pt' color='#444444'&gt;·&lt;tab&gt;&lt;/tab&gt;&lt;/font&gt;If you are able to answer most of the questions raised, you can be sure that you have understood it all well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/textformat&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align='left'&gt;&lt;textformat leading='1' tabstops='[48, 96]' leftmargin='0' indent='0'&gt;&lt;font face='Articulate' size='11.64pt' color='#444444'&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.
